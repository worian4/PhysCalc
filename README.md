# PhysCalc
PhysCalc is an analog to apps like Photomath, but equievalent for physics.

If you want to locate the class only, download ```core/calc.py```, but i highly reccomend installing all files, as they content basic formulas, constants and formulas to turn input units to system of notation units. Also, in main.py you can see the examples of input and how to upload res.
